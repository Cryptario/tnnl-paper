## tnnl: A Privacy Layer for Standards-Compliant Fungible Tokens

**ABSTRACT:** The current Ethereum token-oriented ecosystem is lacking in
privacy. With the 'Byzantium' hard-fork to the Ethereum network,
it became possible to implement a confidential transaction system
using zk-SNARKs; however, with a preexisting token infrastructure,
it is a non-trivial amount of work for current tokens that are in
want of privacy features to incorporate the technology enabled by
the latest hard-fork. We propose a system that provides 
_all_ preexisting ERC20-compliant, ERC223-compliant, ERC677-compliant, and ERC777-compliant tokens
a means of operating in a confidential manner.
